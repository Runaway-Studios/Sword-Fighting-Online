## Supported Versions

All versions earlier than the publicly available one will always be unsupported unless we later find we have made a mistake releasing a newer version. This doesn't mean that you won't be able to acess those versions, it just means that we will not be commiting to them.

Models, decals, sounds and other assests will not get unsupported, even if we don't use them anymore. This is because we might use the assests again sometime.

Note that not all versions will be unsupported and this security policy is subject to change anytime.

The latest version of the game is: v0.0.5, The latest build is: 2021-03-06. These versions will get unsupported after a new version has been released
